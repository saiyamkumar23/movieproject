## Final Project for our Drawing on The Web Class. 
Since we are both interested in film and filmmaking, we wanted to focus our project around our passion of cinema. Our project seeks to recreate the atmosphere, mood, and visual imagery of three of our favorite movie’s. Using inspiration from each movie’s visual aesthetic, narrative storyline, and symbolic motifs our projects will serve as an interactive and web-based film poster. While the traditional film posters are a simple and convenient way to promote a particular movie to potential viewers, they often fail to capture the full emotional atmosphere of that movie. Utilizing the array of artistic tool provided by the web-browser, such as CSS Transitions/Transform/Animation, Scalable Vector Graphics and HTML Canvas we will bring each film poster to life in a way that will better capture the essence of the movie. Each scene will be set with an atmospheric background based off of key scenes within the films. Important symbols and props from each movie will be placed on the web page and will respond to user interaction. Finally, thematic music will play in the background to further envelope the viewer into the world of the movie.
